# Tickets for 1/29/21
### Database:
#### With the database we are making a functional sign up page which the information is going to be on a sql database. 
#### The database is going to store the information for the usernames, passwords, and emails of the users.
#### After you complete the signing up you will be able to use that information to login to our website

### Easter Egg:
#### We are going to have a secret page hidden in our website.
#### To find this Easter Egg you have to click on a certain image in our website.
#### This is going to go to a secret game of snake, as well as other code for collegeboard requirements that doesn't fit into our main project.
#### For example, here is a little code that shows our knowledge of metadata:https://repl.it/@BradleyBartelt1/WebscrapeCollegeBoard#main.py
#### This could be emnedded into our easter egg.

### UI update:
#### We are going to do a whole UI re work because pf the many flaws our previous website had
#### The different pages are going to be changed to make the website look cleaner with a white background and better formating.
#### This will help make our web api look better and also our the sign up page better.

# Goals Completed 1/11 - 1/15:
### Webscrape:
#### We had a Web Api that pulled data through a search bar in our website
#### You search up the stock symbol and once you hit search the price for that stock would pop up.
### <a href="https://github.com/D1935827V/webscrape/projects/1#card-52843095/" target="_blank">About Page</a>
#### We made an about page that has videos and a description for what stocks are. This page has different layout code to it and is there for those who don't know that much about stocks and to teach them what our website is about.
### Deployment: 
#### With Dane out of town we didn't have a Rasberry pi so we used Bradley's laptop to run the website.
#### We had a custom domain name and deployed the website on a windows machine.

# Summary:
### Delivery Plans and Content for big Milestones (Fridays, Mid Term, N@tM, and College Board): Big Ticket features with Visuals (UI mockup, Table of data you need to capture, ...):
### Our project is supposed to simulate a stock trading website. It will retrieve stock price information from the internet, then allow users to invest fake money, and track how well their stocks do. We will have a login system where people can make accounts and then track their stocks each day using their profiles.

# Timeline and Completed Aspects:
### This is the link to our active project timeline/ scrum board on padlet: https://padlet.com/bradleybartelt/v44y76kaxvlyg9pd	
### 1/4/2020: Just migrated to new repository due to enviornment corruption

### We will track these big-ticket items on the Padlet. This Padlet will be updated as we work on the project to help keep track of our goals and what we have completed. The big-ticket items that will be tracked are: Back Log, Assigned, In Progress, Ready for Deploy (In GitHub), Completed (Running on Pi).   	
### We will track these big-ticket items on the Padlet. This Padlet will be updated as we work on the project to help keep track of our goals and what we have completed. The big-ticket items that we have come up with are accounts (user database), login page, data web scraping, and a leaderboard for the person with the highest gains.

## Big idea #2 and #3:
### Creating a user database in order to store user information on specific stocks they invested in. We will be extending our use of python to include web scraping. We will have a data driven ui because each user will have an account page.

## Big idea #3 :
### We have created what we want our front page of the website to look like in a google drawing. This google drawing can be seen in the padlet. We also are going to use data in order to provide a custom experience for each individual user.

## Big idea #4: 
### We will be hosting our website on a raspberry pie. We will also be using HTTP and POST in order to update our websites data on stock prices and calculate how well users portfolioâ€™s are doing. 

## Big idea #5:
### Our website will be a cool tool to help students learn how to work with stocks. It provides a safe, risk free way to familiarize yourself with investing in stocks and it does a good job showing off what we are capable of with python and HTML.
